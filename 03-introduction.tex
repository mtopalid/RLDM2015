\section{Introduction}

	A lot of times during a day, we are asked to make decisions of different kind, important or not. Each of these decisions show who we are, through influencing our behaviour and habits. Nowadays, many scientists are involved in research of understanding the underlying mechanisms of this high-level cognitive function. It is a widely held view that basal ganglia participate in decision making, but with unknown role regarding the formations of habits. How an animal can shift from a known behaviour with expected outcome to a habitual one?
	
	Piron experimented with monkeys on a two-armed bandit task under a pharmacological approach, combining habitual behaviour and procedural learning. In this kind of tasks, the subjects are requested to determine the initial unknown outcome of a choice among different options. During a trial, two different shapes are presented to a screen in front of a monkey. Each shape is interlaced with a reward probability (0.75 and 0.25). Its task is to choose one by pushing a button relevant to the position of the shape. Finish of the movement indicates reward delivery according to chosen shape's probability. Through repetition, the monkey decodes the hidden outcomes and chooses almost each time the shape with the highest one. Then, they interchange between trials with familiar targets of explicit values and new pairs of targets of implicit value. A reflexive behaviour was triggered by the former trials in which the choice was the best option and quick, while the later are associated to an exploratory early phase and a late exploitation phase of a learning process. Yet, they inactivated the internal part of the Globus Pallidus (GPi), the main output structure of the BG with injections of muscimol. They concluded that disruption of BG output resulted to inability of learning new contingencies, while the reflexive choice of known target was slightly slower, but not impaired.

	We introduce a computation model that simulates cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, able to solve the two-armed bandit task, as described above, using reinforcement learning and explicit valuation of outcome (Guthrie et al., 2013). Our results demonstrate that Hebbian learning at cortical level after each move, and not only after reward, is sufficient for the model to choose always the best option. Then, by inhibiting the output nuclei of the model (GPi), we show how learning has been transferred from the basal ganglia to the cortex, simply as a consequence of the statistics of the choice. Our results are consisted with equivalent monkeys' experiments (unpublished data at the time of writing) and suggest that the basal ganglia implicitly teach cortex the values of new options. In the end, it is demonstrated the ability of cortex to solve the task perfectly, even if it exhibits slower reaction times.
